            A "book" is a physical object, typically containing many pages (of paper, parchment, or vellum) bound together along one edge and protected by a cover. It can also refer to the written, printed, or graphic content within that book. Historically, the term "book" has evolved from scrolls to the modern codex format, which is a collection of sheets bound together.
